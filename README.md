## Quick Start

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Create `.env.local` with:

```env
MONGODB_URI=your-mongodb-connection-string
JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret-at-least-32-chars
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

3. Run dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Run smoke-test (basic API check):

```bash
npm run smoke-test
```

## Smoke Test

`scripts/api-smoke-test.js` performs a simple signup/login against the running dev server.

## Scripts

- `npm run smoke-test` - Run API smoke test
- `npm run check-2fa` - Check 2FA functionality
- `npm run seed-data` - Seed database with sample data
- `npm run test-db` - Test database connection
- `npm run validate-env` - Validate environment variables

## Notes

- API implementations are basic and intended for development. Review security before production use.
- If you see DNS errors connecting to MongoDB Atlas, verify `MONGODB_URI` and that your machine/network can resolve SRV records.
- 2FA uses the `speakeasy` library for TOTP generation and verification.
